The issue stemmed from implicit type conversion of variant variables.  The function was performing arithmetic operations on variants that contained both numeric and string values which resulted in unexpected data type conversion and ultimately wrong calculations. 

The solution involves explicitly converting variants to the appropriate data type (e.g., using CInt, CDbl, or CStr) before performing operations. This ensures that calculations are performed as intended.  The corrected function also incorporates robust error handling, checking for invalid input and preventing runtime errors.  In the corrected version, type checking is implemented at the beginning of the function, which provides early detection and avoids unexpected results.  This ensures the function always operates with the correct data type.
